# Bioinformatics with Python 

This repository contains small bioinformatics programs written in Python as part of my learning process following the book *Mastering Python for Bioinformatics*.

The goal of this project is to practice:
- Command-line tools with 'argparse'
- File handling
- Modular programming
- Basic testing concepts
- Version control with Git and GitHub
