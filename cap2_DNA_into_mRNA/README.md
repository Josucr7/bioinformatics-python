# DNA Sequence to mRNA Sequence.

## Description
This project translates a DNA sequence into a messenger RNA (mRNA) sequence by replacing the nucleotide thymine (T) with the nucleotide uracil (U).
The DNA sequence is provided only through input files.

## Concepts Practiced
- Using `argparse` to handle command-line arguments.
- Reading input from file(s).
- Creating an ouput directory to store mRNA sequences.
- Generating output files using Python
## Requirements
- Python 3
- Input DNA sequence files.

## Usage
```bash
python DNA.py input_file
